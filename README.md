   QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
   ==========================================
   
   CONTAINER PROPERTIES (on parent):
   ----------------------------------
   display: flex;               → Enables flexbox
   flex-direction: row;         → Items go horizontally (default)
   flex-direction: column;      → Items go vertically
   justify-content: center;     → Center on main axis
   justify-content: space-between; → Space between items
   align-items: center;         → Center on cross axis
   flex-wrap: wrap;             → Allow items to wrap
   gap: 20px;                   → Space between items
   
   ITEM PROPERTIES (on children):
   -------------------------------
   flex: 1;                     → Grow equally to fill space
   flex: 2;                     → Grow twice as much as flex: 1
   min-width: 250px;            → Prevent getting too narrow
   
   REMEMBER:
   ---------
   • display: flex goes on the PARENT (container)
   • The CHILDREN automatically become flex items
   • Main axis = direction of flex-direction
   • Cross axis = perpendicular to main axis
